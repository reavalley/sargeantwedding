<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>
    We first met at Staffordshire University in 2007 but it was until after uni in the summer of 2011 we began to know each other properly.
    Hayley started horse riding ‘Scamp’ regularly at the farm, so we spent more and more time together and became great friends and then eventually in March 2012 we became a couple.

<p>
    We moved in together in December 2013 before moving to Westbury in September 2014.
